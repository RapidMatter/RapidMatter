#RapidMatter Design Concept
#Mission Statement: Vendor-Agnostic Enterprise-Architecture-Design-as-a-Service
#Problems Solved
    Long time-to-market for expert enterprise infrastructure architecture design
    Fragmented design documentation
    Unnecessarily complicated designs
    Lack of a single repository for designs of an organisation
    Poor design skills in the market
    Lack of vendor-agnostic training courses
    DIY design repositories â€“ eg. SharePoint site with outdated powerpoints, word documents and visio diagrams that no-one reads
    Absence of supporting documentation
    Very difficult to validate the efficacy of designed solutions, the tools do not exist, manually intensive and difficult to quantify
#Objectives
    To provide a universal language for Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture Design that aligns with the Zachman Framework and CCAr/VCDX/NPX design methodologies.
    To provide the fastest time to market for CCAr/VCDX/NPX-level Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture Design (hours and days, not weeks and months).
    To provide the tools to quickly build a complete architecture design with supporting documentation that an implementation team can use to successfully deliver a project.
    To reduce the risk of bad design and improve the chances of success.
    To provide a central infrastructure repository of requirements, design decisions and supporting documentation.
    To provide a continuous, central and secure design repository for each registered entity using a common and extensible design methodology.
    To allow customers, value added resellers and vendors to contribute to the central design database, that will allow the reuse of work product.
    To allow anyone to build vendor-agnostic designs and translate these into vendor-specific engineering specifications.
    To allow concurrent, multi-user collaboration on enterprise infrastructure architecture design.
    To provide a wizard-based design tool that beginners, advanced and expert enterprise architects can easily use.
    To provide training materials for enterprise infrastructure architecture design.

#Day 1 Features
    Functioning User Interface with User Registration and User Design Repository.
    Functioning Design Wizard with Beginner, Advanced and Expert modes for Private Cloud and Data Center Virtualisation.
    Functioning Design Database populated with Conceptual Model options (Business Goals, Requirements, Constraints & Assumptions), Logical Design options (Cloud Management Platform, Compute, Network, Storage, Virtual Machine, Security, Backup/Recovery, BC/DR, Virtual Infrastructure Management) and Physical Design options.
    Initially support Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, EMC and Nutanix engineering specifications for physical design (because I have the expertise to populate the design database with this content and validate it).
    Functioning Supporting Documents database (Implementation Plan, Configuration Guide, Test Plan, Standard Operating Procedures, Blueprints).
    Functioning Solution Metrics analysis of each design to measure the chances of success and mitigate risk.
    Functioning Design Pack Export to PDF for design review and implementation.
    To have VCDX and NPX certified enterprise architects contribute to the design database and supporting documents database.
    To have architects of every skill level use the solution and provide feedback on bugs and future improvements.
#Day 2 and Beyond
    Support Service Provider Network, Enterprise Network, End User Computing, Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud design scenarios.
    Support Veeam, VMTurbo, Zerto, HP, Netapp, OpenStack, KVM, Dell, Brocade, IBM, Citrix, SimpliVity, Hitachi, Trend Micro, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks, AWS, Google Compute, Microsoft Azure, etc. engineering specifications.
    Highly Available Virtual Appliance or Public Cloud service that can be deployed in an organisation's infrastructure to host the User Design Repository with SSL VPN access back to RapidMatter.com for the Design Database and Supporting Documentation Database synchronisation.
    Vendors can provide a library of pre-validated designs based upon their solution best practices.
    Solution upgrade design validation (eg. vSphere 5.5 to vSphere 6.0).
    Vendor Specific filtering (Constraints) - if you have a preference for a particular vendor, all other vendors will be filtered out.
